            <p>Hello there!</p>
            <p>It seems like you came across my website! Well congrats and welcome!</p>
            <p>My name is Idan and wish to one day become a Back End developer and to do this I am using this site to implement what I have learnt so far</p>
            <p>I know it doesn't look like much just yet, but give it time and it will grow</p>
            <p>In the mean time, have a look around and if you see something you like, click some buttons and find out what they do</p>
